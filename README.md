### JNetVisualFX


JNetVisualFX is a terminal based NeuralNetwork visualizer with the focus on testing, training and playing around with *Neural Networks*. In the end its also meant as an educational application.

### Install

The application comes already prepackaged in a .zip-archive with a runtime included. Just unzip it and start `JNetVisualFX.exe`.

### How to get started:

Upon starting, you won't have a built network yet. For building your first Network you need a NetBuilder, which is a reusable building block for your network.    
Create a new NetBuilder with `new NetBuilder((4,4,4),sigmoid)`, the first argument being a list of numbers representing the neuronCount each layer. Second is a activationFunction.
You can customize your NetBuilder with further commands to your liking.  
When you have your desired NetBuilder call `new Network` to create a new Network with your NetBuilder.  
Voil√†, you made your first Network now you can play around with it!

### Terminal

The terminal is the central part of JNetVisualFX allowing you to get information, customize the application and interact with networks.  
It supports:
- Adding and deleting characters
- Scrolling through past commands using UP and DOWN (if there's no autocompletion)
- changing cursor position with LEFT and RIGHT  
- Code completion with TAB (if there's only 1 suggestion)

There's lots of useful commands but these here will get you started:
- `help` - displays helpful information 
- `helpall` - lists all commands in the log
- `man` - used as prefix for methods to display their manual page e.g. `man print`

Feel free to experiment around there's a lot of small commands to explore.
